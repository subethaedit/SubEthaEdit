  document state (mode, folding state, window position, selection and more) for 
  plain text files using a extended filesystem attribute.

  a direct click in a fashion that does not interfere with editing.

#### Changes:

* Improved the speed of Applescript based text changes in documents (e.g. the 
  commment/uncomment script in the c-modes)

  "find longest match" option. Starting with 3.0 this option causes only the 
  longest match(es) to be returned. We changed the naming of this option to 
  "Only longest match" and turn it off by default to clarify things.
* Merged the "Capture groups" and "Don't capture groups" as well as "Line 
  context" and "Negate single line" options to simplify user interaction and 
  mirror changes in OgreKit and Oniguruma.

  if the "indent wrapped lines" option was turned on for the current mode.
* Fixed an issue where the encoding setting of the mode was ignored and 
  windows-latin-2 was recognized. The mode encoding setting is now used again 
  if the encoding detector is clueless.
* Fixed an issue with the generated document URL: now when you have a valid 
  IPv6 address it also generates correct URLs, e.g. see://[::1]:6943
* Fixed an issue where link local IPv6 addresses didn't work in the Connections 
  Browser, e.g. see://[fe80::216:cbff:fe89:706e%25en1]:6942/
* Fixed an issue where the document scope popup in the find dialog initially 
  showed both entries checked

  correctly.
* Fixed an issue where the Latex mode didn't recognize symbols.
* Fixed an issue with the C++ mode where inline member functions weren't 
  recognized.
