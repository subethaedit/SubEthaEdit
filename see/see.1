.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm
command allows you to open files in SubEthaEdit via the command line. You can specify one or more file names as arguments for the
.Nm
command to open the corresponding files in SubEthaEdit. It creates a new document for each file name argument that doesn't have a file associated with it and sets the window title to the file name.
.Pp 
.Nm
also reads from stdin when no file name is specified on the command line or it's preceded by a pipe. It writes the contents of the opened files to stdout once you close them in SubEthaEdit and the invoked
.Nm
command is followed by a pipe.
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space

.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed

.It Fl g, -goto Ar line\fP[:\fIcolumn\fP[,\fIlength\fP ] ]
Set the selection to the specified line, column and length. If only line is given the whole line is selected. If line and column is given, a selection with length 0 is set. So select arbitary character ranges use 1:start,length.
.It Fl h, -help
Display usage information and exit.
.It Fl j, -job-description Ar string
Specify a string describing the context in which the command is used. The string will augment the window titles of all opened documents providing the context of the job in the user interface.
.It Fl l, -launch
Launch SubEthaEdit or activate it, if it's already running.
.It Fl m, -mode Ar identifier
Specify the identifier of a mode to open the specified file(s) using that mode.
.It Fl o, -open-in Ar [\fIwhere\fP ]
Specify in which container the files should be openend. Possible containers are: tabs windows new-window.
.It Fl p, -print

.It Fl r, -resume

.It Fl d, -pipe-dirty
Make the document containing the text from stdin dirty so it shows a dialog on close.
.It Fl t, -pipe-title Ar string
Specify a string which should be used as the window title for the document containing the text from stdin.
.It Fl v, -version
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl w, -wait
Wait until all specified files have been closed in SubEthaEdit. Set the EDITOR environment variable to \&"see -w\&" to use
