UKXATTRMETADATASTORE
--------------------

A wrapper class around the xattr API in MacOS X 10.4 and later.

You can use this class to add metadata to files on your hard disk that
will stay attached to the file even if it is moved, renamed or otherwise
changed. Included are some convenience methods that transparently let you
attach UTF8 strings and property-list-type objects.

commercial products free of charge, however distributing modified copies
requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug
reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.
